"""pyeasyga

A simple and easy-to-use genetic algorithm implementation library in Python.

For a bit array solution representation, simply instantiate the
GeneticAlgorithm class with input data, define and supply a fitness function,
run the Genetic Algorithm, and retrieve the solution!

Other solution representations will require setting some more attributes.
